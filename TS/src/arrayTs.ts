//Arrays in TypeScript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3] // The compiler will array type to Number because all the elements in the array are numbers
let num1: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4] //We can also mannually set type of a array;

//num1[4] ='1'; //This will be invalid because type of num1 is number and not any!
